SDL Game Engine
Welcome to the SDL Game Engine! This engine provides a robust set of systems to kickstart your game development journey with SDL. It includes essential features like:

Scene System: Manage and transition between different game scenes effortlessly.
Interactive and Static UI: Create intuitive and engaging user interfaces.
Signal System: Decouple event handling with a powerful signal-slot mechanism.
With this engine, setting up your project is incredibly straightforward.

üì¶ Setting Up the Engine
Create the Project Structure:

Create a folder called engine and place all the engine's source code there.
Create another folder called scenes and add a header file named sceneUtils.h in it.
Setup sceneUtils.h: Paste the following code into sceneUtils.h:

```
// Contains all important headers to build a scene
#ifndef SU_H
#define SU_H

#include "../UI.h"
#include "../baseScene.h"
#include "../input.h"
#include "../Signals.h"
#include "../sceneManager.h"

class Utils {
public:
    Signals* signal;

    Utils() {
        if (!signal) {
            signal = new Signals;
        }
    }
};

#endif
```

All Set! You‚Äôre now ready to start creating your game with the engine.

üõ†Ô∏è Examples
Below are examples of how you can use this engine to build a main menu for your game.

menu.h:
```
// SCENE INDEX 0

#ifndef MM_H
#define MM_H

#include "sceneUtils.h"

class MainMenu : public Scene {
public:
    Utils* utils;

    MainMenu(SDL_Renderer* renderer, TTF_Font* font, SceneM* sm, std::vector<Scene*> scenes)
        : Scene(renderer, font), utils(new Utils()) {

        if (!utils) {
            utils = new Utils(); // Or initialize through dependency injection.
        }

        addButton(new Button(300, 200, 200, 50, "Start Game", renderer, font, 30, 0, SDL_Color{ 0, 255, 0, 255 }));
        addButton(new Button(300, 300, 200, 50, "Exit", renderer, font, 30, 1));
    }

    ~MainMenu() { sceneDeletionProcedures(); std::cout << "MainMenu destroyed\n"; }

    void onreadywithparam(SceneM* sm, std::vector<Scene*> scenes) override;
    void onready() override;
    void handleEvents(bool& running) override;
    void getButtonFunc(int id) override;
    void setBG() override;

    void sceneDeletionProcedures() override;

public:
    static void start_game(SceneM* sm, std::vector<Scene*> scenes);

private:
    bool should_quit = false;
};

#endif // !MM_H
```

menu.cpp:
The menu.cpp file handles the functionality of the menu buttons and background. For a detailed implementation, check the full source code in this repository.

Main File Example:
Set up your main file to integrate the engine and handle game logic:

```
#include <SDL.h>
#include <SDL_ttf.h>
#include <SDL_image.h>
#include <iostream>
#include "allScenes.h"
#include "input.h"
#include "sceneManager.h"

#undef main

std::vector<Scene*> scenes;

void addScenes(SDL_Renderer* renderer, TTF_Font* font, std::vector<Scene*>& scenes, SceneM* sm) 
{
    scenes.push_back(new MainMenu(renderer, font, sm, scenes));
    scenes.push_back(new MainGame(renderer, font, sm, scenes));
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    // Initialize SDL, create the window, renderer, and load assets
    // See the full code above for implementation details

    bool running = true;
    while (running) {
        // Main game loop
    }

    // Cleanup code
    return 0;
}
```
